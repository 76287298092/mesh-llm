# Assembly inventory

| Source symbol | Operation | Required target | Reference | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `kernels/nvptx/probes.rs:probe_nvfp4_mma`, lane read | Thread identity | NVPTX | Lane-indexed input/output contract | Qualified within the 32-case probe |
| `kernels/nvptx/probes.rs:probe_nvfp4_mma`, MMA | 16x8x64 block-scaled FP4 multiply | SM120a, PTX8.7 | Independent scalar decoded matrices | 4,096 exact matches; see [evidence](findings/rust-nvfp4-probe.md) |
| `kernels/nvptx/probes.rs:panic` | Fail-fast trap | NVPTX | Unexpected panic must fail launch | Unqualified |
| `kernels/nvptx/memory.rs:probe_shared_load`, lane/address/copy/barrier | `cp.async.ca/cg`, commit and wait, shared synchronization | SM120a | Two seeded 256-halfword arrays | 16 cases pass; sanitizers clean |
| `kernels/nvptx/memory.rs:load_x2/load_x4` | Normal/transposed `ldmatrix` x2/x4 | SM120a | Logical 8x8 row/column mapping in `memory_fixtures.rs` | 2,048 exact outputs with copies |
| `kernels/nvptx/ordinary_mma.rs` | BF16/FP16 m16n8k16 and INT8 m16n8k32 MMA, lane read | SM120a | Twelve independent scalar matrix products in `ordinary_fixtures.rs` | 1,536 exact outputs; sanitizers clean |
| `kernels/nvptx/register_budget.rs` | `setmaxnreg` dec24/inc64, barriers, thread read | SM120a | 128 exact XOR outputs; launch requires reported allocation >=64 registers | 128 outputs pass; 64 registers reported; sanitizers clean |
| `kernels/nvptx/rms_norm.rs` | Shared reduction, barriers, explicit rounded FP32 arithmetic, thread/block coordinates | SM120a | Independent f64 RMSNorm; fixture integration pending | Execution pending |
| `kernels/nvptx/nvfp4_gemm.rs` | Repeated NVFP4 MMA, lane/block coordinates | SM120a | Independent logical GEMM; fixture integration pending | Execution pending |

Compiler emission alone is not qualification. Keep execution evidence and any
failed attempts in a findings/dead-ends entry before promoting these rows.
